# Hi, I'm Alex 👋
Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo focused on building scalable, data-driven systems across cloud, security, and applied machine learning.

## 🧩 What I Build With

I primarily work in Python and C++ to design backend systems, automation pipelines, and ML-driven applications.  

My experience spans:
- Cloud-native automation on Microsoft Azure  
- Security-conscious infrastructure analysis  
- Applied ML in bioinformatics and computer vision  
- Full-stack prototyping with REST APIs and Firebase
---

## I’m passionate about building systems that are both technically deep and genuinely useful. If you’re interested in AI, security, or machine learning, or just want to exchange ideas, I’d love to connect 🌐
